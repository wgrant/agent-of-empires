# Design: server-side prompt queue (closed-app delivery + force-send)

Status: implemented (G1 through G4).
Opened 2026-08-14.

Implemented:

- Durable per-session queue on the `Instance` (`queued_prompts` +
  `queued_prompt_next_seq`, `QueuedPromptEntry`), persisted like
  `pending_initial_turn`. Chosen over a dedicated SQLite table for consistency
  with the existing pending-turn pattern and free WS/multi-device sync via the
  session list (revises Q1).
- `SessionService` enqueue / edit / remove / clear / snapshot and
  `drain_queued_prompts_once`; a reconciler pass drains the head batch at
  turn-end (folded ACP turn inactive, live worker) with the `/clear`-boundary split
  (`queue_drain_batch`) that used to live in the client. `queued_prompts` is
  surfaced on `SessionResponse`.
- Wake-on-drain: a dormant (idle-auto-stopped) session with a queue has its
  marker cleared so the resume pass respawns it, then the next tick drains
  (deadlock-safe; see "Wake-on-drain" below).
- Attachments ride with a queued prompt: the enqueue POST buffers the bytes in
  the event store's `pending_attachments` table (keyed by prompt id, outside the
  seq-keyed retention prune), the drain reloads and forwards them, and a
  per-session byte cap + hourly TTL bound the buffer (Q5).
- HTTP: `POST/GET/DELETE /api/sessions/{id}/queue`,
  `PATCH/DELETE /api/sessions/{id}/queue/{promptId}`, and atomic
  `POST /api/sessions/{id}/queue/{promptId}/send-now`, CityHall-classified like
  `acp/prompt`. Web API client wrappers + Vitest.
- Client rewired to the server queue (`useAcpSession`): `sendPrompt`'s enqueue
  branch POSTs to `/queue` with an optimistic `pending` row and confirms it;
  edit/remove/clear mirror to the endpoints; the queue reconciles against the
  server snapshot via `hydrate_server_queue` (on connect and turn-end), keeping
  local attachment thumbnails and any in-flight enqueue. The old client drain,
  `AcpQueueDrainer`/`AcpBackgroundDrainers`, and `acpDrainCoordinator` are
  removed (the daemon drains now). A one-time migration on first connect pushes
  any localStorage-restored rows to the server.

Real-time cross-device queue updates (a WS event on queue mutation) remain
future work; today other devices see queue changes on their next connect or
turn-end hydrate.

### Why queued attachments get their own store (resolved)

Attachments could not reuse the `acp_attachments` store: it keys blobs by the
`seq` of the `UserPromptSent` event they ride with, and the retention prune drops
any blob whose owning event no longer exists (`src/events/mod.rs`, `DELETE ...
WHERE seq <= cutoff AND seq NOT IN (SELECT seq FROM events)`). A queued-but-unsent
prompt has no `UserPromptSent` seq, so its bytes would be pruned early or need a
synthetic-seq hack that fights the retention invariant. (`pending_initial_turn`
sidesteps this only because it replays refs whose bytes were already stored under
a prior real prompt's seq.) So queued attachments live in a dedicated
`pending_attachments` table keyed by `(session_id, ref_id=prompt_id,
attachment_id)`, outside the seq-keyed prune; the drain re-records them under the
real `UserPromptSent` seq and drops the pending copy. This resolves Q1/Q5.

### Wake-on-drain (implemented)

A queued prompt normally drains at turn-end while the worker is still live, so
the queue empties before the idle reaper can auto-stop the worker. But a prompt
enqueued against an already-dormant session (a laptop queuing to a phone-session
whose worker was auto-stopped, or a drain that kept failing until dormancy) must
still deliver. The naive "let the drain run for dormant sessions too" deadlocks:
`send_turn` does wake a dormant/dead worker (`src/server/session_service.rs`,
`needs_resume = woke_idle_dormant || !is_running`), but `drain_queued_prompts_once`
holds the session `instance_lock` across `send_turn`, and `trigger_resume_background`'s
detached spawn takes that same lock (`src/server/acp_reconciler.rs`, "Callers MUST
NOT hold the session's `instance_lock`"; #3172).

The fix sidesteps the lock entirely. `drain_queued_prompts` splits by worker
state: a live worker drains as before; a **dormant** session with a queue has
its idle-dormant marker cleared (`SessionService::wake_dormant_for_queue_drain`,
persisted via the instances-write path, never `instance_lock`). Clearing the
marker un-excludes the session from the reconciler's resume pass, which respawns
the worker under its normal respawn budget/park guard; the following tick then
drains via the live-worker branch. No `trigger_resume_background` is ever called
from the drain, so the #3172 lock-order hazard cannot occur. The idle reaper is
guarded to skip sessions with a non-empty queue, so it cannot re-sink a session
faster than wake-on-drain revives it (no oscillation). A deliberately-stopped
session (status `Stopped`, not `Idle`) is never a drain candidate, so this only
ever revives sessions the idle reaper auto-stopped. Covered by
`wake_dormant_for_queue_drain_clears_only_when_dormant` and
`drain_queued_prompts_wakes_a_dormant_session_with_a_queue`; the full
reaper -> dormant -> enqueue -> wake -> drain cycle is exercised by the client
rewire's live queue round-trip (cheaper and more representative than a
config-forced-dormancy Rust e2e).

## Problem

Two structured-view (SV) asks share one root cause:

1. A follow-up prompt the user queues while the agent is busy is **not delivered
   if the PWA is closed** on the client. On an installed iOS PWA the user
   queues a message, locks the phone, and the message never sends.
2. There is **no reliable "force send now"** for a queued prompt when a turn is
   active and the agent is not steerable. The shipped per-row "Send now" (see
   below) only fires when an immediate send can already reach the agent.

Both stem from the queue being **client-only**.

## Current architecture (as of this doc)

- The SV prompt queue is React reducer state (`state.queuedPrompts`) mirrored to
  `localStorage` under `aoe:acp-state:v1:<id>` (`useAcpSession.ts`). Queued rows
  with attachments are dropped from persistence; attachments live in memory only.
- Delivery is a **client drain effect**: when the turn ends and the socket is
  open and the worker is running, the browser combines the leading batch and
  POSTs `/api/sessions/{id}/acp/prompt`. Off-screen sessions drain via up to 3
  headless `AcpBackgroundDrainers`, still only while a tab is open.
- The daemon has **no user-prompt queue**. `pending_initial_turn` is the
  rate-limit resume continuation, not the user's mid-turn queue.
- The service worker (`web/public/sw.js`) is push-only: no `fetch` handler, no
  Background Sync. iOS Safari does not support Background Sync, so a
  service-worker retry path cannot deliver on the primary target platform.

Net: close the app and the queue (state + drain) dies with the page.

## What already shipped (force-send)

A per-row "Send now" affordance exists in `QueuedPromptsStrip`, backed by
`useAcpSession.sendQueuedNow(prompt)`. When the agent is free or steerable, the
client invokes the daemon's atomic send-now action. The daemon forwards the
stored text and attachment bytes, then retires the queue row only after the
send succeeds. When a live non-steerable turn is blocking it, "Send now"
**interrupts**: it cancels the current turn, and the queued prompts drain via
the normal turn-end path (no POST during the cancel, which the daemon would
treat as a wedge). The button's tooltip warns when it will interrupt.

## What already works with the client closed (audit)

The requirement is "an in-progress SV session keeps working when the phone is
closed." Most of it already holds, because the agent does not run on the phone:

- **The agent worker runs on the daemon host**, as a detached `aoe __acp-runner`
  process registered in `src/process/worker_registry.rs`. It outlives client
  disconnects and even `aoe serve --stop`. Closing the phone does not stop a
  running turn.
- **The transcript is durably persisted** in the daemon's event store
  (`src/acp/event_store.rs`, SQLite). A turn runs to completion and its events
  are stored whether or not a client is connected; a reconnecting client
  replays them. So "the agent stops when I lock my phone" is not the case
  today.

What genuinely still needs *a* client open (not necessarily the phone):

1. **Delivering a queued follow-up prompt.** The queue and its drain are
   client-only, so a message queued behind a busy turn is stranded when the app
   closes. This is the gap this design closes (G1/G2).
2. **Answering a permission/approval prompt** when the session is not in
   yolo/bypass mode. Approvals sit in `pending_approvals` until a client
   resolves them (`src/acp/approvals.rs`); the turn blocks meanwhile. This is
   inherently interactive, not a queue problem: it is already answerable from
   any signed-in device, and push notifications alert the user. For unattended
   phone-closed operation the session should run in yolo/bypass mode, or the
   user answers from another device. Out of scope for the queue work, but worth
   stating so "phone closed" is understood end to end.

So after this design lands, the only remaining phone-closed caveat is approvals
on a non-yolo session, which is a deliberate interaction, not a bug. (The daemon
host running `aoe serve` must of course still be up; "phone closed" refers to
the mobile client, not the server.)

## Goals

- G1: A queued prompt is delivered even if the client PWA is closed, as soon as
  the agent is free, with no tab open.
- G2: Queued prompts (and their attachments) survive a client reload / device
  handoff.
- G3: "Force send now" works even during an active non-steering turn (cancel the
  turn, then send), as an explicit user action.
- G4: No duplicate delivery when both a live client and the server could drain.

## Proposed design

Move the queue's **source of truth to the daemon**, per session, and let the
server own draining. The client becomes a view/editor of the server queue plus a
fast optimistic path.

### Data model

A durable per-session queue in the daemon (alongside the session store or in the
event-log DB):

```
queued_prompt(
  session_id      TEXT,
  id              TEXT,     -- client-minted, stable across edits (existing QueuedPrompt.id)
  seq             INTEGER,  -- server order; assigned on enqueue
  text            TEXT,
  attachments     BLOB,     -- serialized PromptAttachmentInput[]; see attachment note
  created_at      TEXT,
  origin_device   TEXT,     -- which device enqueued (for provenance / multi-device)
  PRIMARY KEY (session_id, id)
)
```

Ordering is by `seq`. The `/clear`-boundary batching rule stays server-side so a
queued clear-command still fires as its own POST.

### Lifecycle

- **Enqueue**: client POSTs the prompt to a new `POST /api/sessions/{id}/queue`
  the moment it decides to queue (today it only writes localStorage). The row is
  persisted server-side immediately, independent of turn/socket state. Response
  echoes the assigned `seq`.
- **Drain**: the daemon drains the head of the queue into the worker when the
  turn ends (it already observes turn end for status), applying the same
  clear-boundary split. This runs in the reconciler / supervisor, not the
  client, so it fires with no tab open. Idle-auto-stopped workers are woken the
  same way a direct prompt wakes them.
- **Edit / remove / reorder / clear**: `PATCH`/`DELETE` on
  `/api/sessions/{id}/queue/{promptId}` and a clear-all. These mutate the
  server queue; the client reflects via the existing WS event stream.
- **Force-send now (G3)**: `POST /api/sessions/{id}/queue/{promptId}/send-now`.
  Server behavior:
  - idle: prompt immediately, then retire the queue row.
  - active + steerable: inject via `_session/steering`, then retire the row.
  - unavailable or non-steerable: refuse without mutating the row. The client
    handles the explicit interrupt action by cancelling first; normal drain
    delivers the preserved row after turn-end.

### Client changes

- `sendPrompt`'s enqueue branch calls the queue POST instead of only
  dispatching `enqueue_prompt` locally. Keep an optimistic local row for
  instant UI, reconciled against the server queue that arrives over the WS.
- Drain effect and `AcpBackgroundDrainers` are **removed** (server drains now).
  `sendQueuedNow` becomes a thin call to `send-now`.
- The queue is now surfaced by the server, so it is visible across the user's
  devices (a queued prompt on the phone shows on the laptop). Decide whether
  that is desired (see Q3).

### Attachments (G2)

Attachments currently never persist (quota) and drop on reload. Server-side
storage removes the browser-quota constraint: store attachment bytes in the
session's artifact dir keyed by prompt id, referenced from the queue row. Cap
total queued attachment bytes per session; reject over-cap enqueues with a clear
error rather than silently dropping.

### Dedup / single-drain (G4)

The daemon is the only drainer, so the client-vs-client and tab-vs-tab races the
current module-scoped drain lock guards go away. The remaining race is
optimistic-echo vs server-confirmed row: reuse the existing optimistic-id
rollback pattern (`rollback_optimistic_prompt`) keyed on the queue row id.

## Alternatives considered

- **Background Sync in the service worker**: retries a POST after the page
  closes. Rejected as primary: unsupported on iOS Safari (the main PWA target),
  and it only retries a send the client already committed to, not a
  wait-for-idle drain.
- **Keep client queue, add `keepalive`/`sendBeacon` on unload**: delivers an
  in-flight send during teardown, but cannot wait for the agent to be free, so
  it does not solve a message queued behind a long-running turn.

## Open questions

- Q1: Storage home for the queue: the session store JSON vs the event-log
  SQLite. The event log already has per-session durable storage and retention;
  leaning that way.
- Q2: Migration for prompts currently sitting in `localStorage`. On first load
  after upgrade, flush any local `queuedPrompts` to the server queue, then drop
  the local copy. One-time, best-effort.
- Q3: Multi-device visibility. A server queue is naturally cross-device; the
  current copy is per-browser. Confirm the product wants the queue shared across
  a user's devices (it likely does, and it matches how sessions already sync).
- Q4: CityHall / read-only interactions and the operator agent allowlist: the
  drain runs server-side, so it must re-check policy at drain time, not just at
  enqueue.
- Q5: Retention: how long a queued-but-undrained prompt lives before it expires
  (e.g. a session that never becomes idle again).

## Test plan (when built)

- Rust: enqueue/drain/edit/remove/send-now unit + a live-daemon e2e that queues
  behind an active turn, drops the client, and asserts delivery on turn end.
- Web: live Playwright for the queue round-trip and cross-device visibility;
  Vitest for the optimistic-reconcile reducer path. Update
  `web/tests/coverage-matrix.json`.
