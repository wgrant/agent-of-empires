# Diff View

The diff view reviews what a session changed: the files it touched and a syntax-highlighted diff for each. It exists in the TUI (`D` from the session list) and in the web dashboard (the session split on desktop, the right-panel picker on mobile).

## What is compared

The diff runs against the base branch, resolved per repo: that repo's [base override](#base-override), then the branch its worktree was forked from, then `diff.default_branch`, then auto-detection. Auto-detection considers every configured remote, so a fork plus `upstream` layout compares against the branch point rather than a stale fork main. When the base resolves to a local branch strictly behind its `origin/` counterpart, the diff compares against the remote tip, so upstream commits you have not pulled are not shown as session changes.

Each entry carries a status letter: `A` added, `M` modified, `D` deleted, `R` renamed, `C` copied, `?` untracked, `U` unmerged. Binary files and files too large to render inline show a header and stats with no hunk body.

## In the TUI

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` or arrows | Move between files |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn`, wheel | Scroll the diff |
| `g` / `G` | Jump to top / bottom |
| `s` | Toggle split and unified layout |
| `b` | Change the base branch |
| `e` or `Enter` | Open the file in `$EDITOR` (vim or nano otherwise) |
| `y` | Copy the file's repo-relative path |
| `r` | Refresh |
| `?` / `Esc` | Help / close |

The diff refreshes automatically after you save and exit the editor.

## In the web dashboard

The changed-files list has two layouts, toggled in its header: **flat** lists every path, **tree** nests them under collapsible directories with per-directory file counts and `+`/`-` stats. Arrow keys move the selection, left and right expand or collapse a directory, and Enter or Space opens a file. Per-repo collapse state persists to your web settings. Right-click a file or folder for **Copy relative path**. On a file, **Open file** opens its current working-tree copy in a new browser tab. It is disabled for deleted files.

The **Files** pane (folder icon in the activity bar) browses the session's whole working directory, not just its git changes, so it lists files even in a non-git scratch session. Right-click a file there for the same **Open file** and **Copy relative path** actions. Markdown renders as HTML with a **Rendered** / **Raw** toggle, in this pane and from the diff list. Files an agent cites that live outside the session's repo open only when that agent actually read or wrote them during this session: the dashboard cannot open an arbitrary host path.

### Split view

Split layout shows old on the left and new on the right, with an aligned placeholder opposite a pure addition or deletion. The TUI stores the choice in `[diff].split_view`; the web dashboard stores it per browser (**Settings > Diff**). Both fall back to unified on a narrow pane.

### Comments (structured view sessions)

The dashboard can annotate diff lines and send the comments to the agent as one prompt:

1. Click the `+` in a line's gutter to start a comment, and `+` on another line in the **same hunk** to extend the range. Clicking across a different hunk or the other side of the diff restarts the selection.
2. Write the comment (markdown supported); `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` saves, `Esc` cancels. Saved comments render inline as editable cards.
3. A banner above the file list appears once you have one: **Send** (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S`) opens a dialog with an editable intro, a preview of each comment with its captured snippet, and an outro. Comments clear on success unless you uncheck "Clear comments after sending".

Comments live in `localStorage` per session. If the agent edits a file so a range no longer matches, the comment moves to a stale-comments block with a `[stale]` chip; its captured snippet still goes to the agent. The feature is hidden for terminal sessions, and Send is disabled while the worker is stopped.

## Base override

Override the branch a repo diffs against when the eventual PR target differs from the project default (stacked PRs, a hotfix off `release/*`, a renamed branch). The override is sticky across restarts and changes only the comparison, never the worktree.

- **Web**: click the `vs <ref>` chip in the diff header and pick a branch, or reset to clear it. A [multi-repo workspace](multi-repo-workspaces.md) has one chip per repo group, listing that repo's branches.
- **TUI**: press `b` in the diff view.
- **CLI**: `aoe session set-base <session> <branch>`, or `--clear` to drop it. In a multi-repo workspace pass `--repo <name>`; without it the command lists the repos and exits.

## Commit ranges

The web diff view can also show a commit range: what one commit adds over another, from their merge-base (git's `base...head`), with no working-tree changes. For a stacked branch this shows one layer's changes alone. A [plugin pane](../plugin-api.md#diff-targets) opens a range when you click one of its rows; the diff header then reads `base...head`, and **Working tree** returns to the usual view. In a multi-repo workspace a range applies to one repo, and the others stay live.

A range is this browser's view only: other devices keep their own, and the session's base override is untouched. **Open file** opens the file as `head` has it. Comments made on a range name it in the prompt, so the agent knows the lines are `head`'s rather than the working tree's, and show inline only while that range is open.

## Configuration

```toml
[diff]
default_branch = "main"   # auto-detected when unset
context_lines = 3
split_view = false
```

To see the same changes while editing, use your editor's gutter integration: [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) or [vim-signify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-signify), [git-gutter](https://github.com/emacsorphanage/git-gutter) for Emacs, [GitGutter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/GitGutter) for Sublime Text. VS Code has it built in.
