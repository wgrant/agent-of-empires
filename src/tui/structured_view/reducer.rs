//! Server-fed view state for the native TUI structured view: the daemon's
//! folded control state plus its ordered transcript rows. Nothing here
//! reduces the raw event stream any more.
//!
//! Since Tier 4 the ORDERED TRANSCRIPT (assistant messages, tool cards,
//! dividers, elicitation answers) is owned by the daemon: it folds the
//! event stream through `TranscriptModel` (`src/acp/transcript.rs`) once and
//! streams the built `TranscriptRow`s over the WS transcript channel (a
//! `transcript_snapshot` on connect, a `transcript_delta` per live event)
//! and via `GET /acp/replay?view=rows`. This reducer holds those rows in
//! `server_rows` and reconciles them by id; `render.rs` projects them to the
//! TUI's text presentation. The web reducer (`web/src/hooks/useAcpSession.ts`)
//! is the authoritative reference for this split.
//!
//! CONTROL state (turn flags, pending approvals / elicitations, usage, mode,
//! available commands, the plan snapshot, the compaction / cancel phases)
//! arrives the same way since Tier 1.3: the daemon folds `AcpState` once and
//! pushes it as a `reduced_state` frame, which
//! [`AcpTranscript::apply_reduced_state`] adopts wholesale. Notes:
//!
//! - Approvals are pure control state (`pending_approvals`), rendered as the
//!   modal approval shelf, not interleaved into the transcript. This matches
//!   the migrated web, whose `ActivityRow` union carries no approval kind:
//!   the tool card the approval gates already sits in `server_rows`.
//! - The two `resolve_*_locally` helpers are the only optimism left: they hide
//!   a card the user just answered until the server's list catches up.
//! - The context-loss notice is derived from the rows rather than latched
//!   from an event. See [`AcpTranscript::context_primer_pending`].
