// Regression for the busy-signal fix (#4001): the main turn ending while a
// background sub-agent (Claude's async Task tool) is still running must not
// leave the composer unable to accept a new prompt.
//
// `AcpRuntime.tsx` briefly fed a combined "is anything busy" signal into
// assistant-ui's `isRunning`, which the library's own `ComposerPrimitive.Input`
// hard-disables Enter under whenever `isRunning && !capabilities.queue` (this
// adapter never declares a queue capability). `Composer.tsx`'s own
// `turnActive`-driven enqueue bypass (the deliberate workaround for that same
// assistant-ui behavior, see #1031) only engages when the real ACP
// `turnActive` is true, so with the main turn idle and only a background
// agent running, `isRunning` had no case sending Enter through: the keystroke
// vanished with no POST, no queue entry, nothing.
