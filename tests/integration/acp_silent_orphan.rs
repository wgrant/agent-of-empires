//! Silent-orphan watchdog (#1240): the adapter stops without returning the
//! `PromptResponse`, and the daemon synthesizes a terminal `Stopped`. What the
//! turn emitted before going quiet decides the reason:
//!   1. wrapped up (cost-bearing usage_update) then silent: the turn finished,
//!      so `prompt_complete` on the fast grace, no cancel, no restart (#2237).
//!   2. never wrapped up: a real wedge, so the base grace expires and the
//!      watchdog cancels with `prompt_orphaned`.
//!   3. off-protocol work pending (async agent, backgrounded Bash, scheduled
//!      wakeup): suppressed until the work can be over.
//!   4. grace = 0: watchdog skipped entirely.
//!
//! Scenarios that depend on a `usage_update` assert the daemon received it, so
//! a fixture the schema rejects cannot pass as case 2 (#3811). Skipped without
//! `node`, and compiled only under `cfg(debug_assertions)` by `main.rs`,
//! because the graces are only tunable there.
