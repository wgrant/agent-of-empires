//! End-to-end coverage for how a Kiro session is launched.
//!
//! Kiro's interactive flags (`--trust-all-tools`, `--agent`)
//! live on the `kiro-cli chat` subcommand, not the top-level binary. AoE used
//! to launch bare `kiro-cli` plus the yolo flag, so YOLO mode produced
//! `kiro-cli --trust-all-tools`, which the real CLI rejects with
//! `error: unexpected argument '--trust-all-tools' found`.
//!
//! These tests drive the full `aoe add --launch` path and assert on the command
//! the launch actually executed, so a regression in launch-command construction
//! is caught at the session-launch layer, not just in the `build_host_command`
//! unit tests. Launches run the pane command through an ephemeral env-file
//! wrapper (`exec <shell> <file>`) that keeps the command out of tmux's
//! `pane_start_command` argv, so we install a recording `kiro-cli` stub and read
//! the argv it was actually invoked with: a more faithful check than the old
//! `pane_start_command` read, since it observes the command as executed.
//!
//! A separate test covers the other half of `--agent` support: that AoE's
//! status hooks are installed into the agent config Kiro actually loads. Kiro
//! resolves `--agent NAME` by the `name` field inside `~/.kiro/agents/*.json`,
//! not the filename, so a generator-managed agent stored as
//! `<prefix>-NAME.json` must still receive the hooks. This drives the full
//! launch path against a seeded agents dir and asserts the on-disk result.
